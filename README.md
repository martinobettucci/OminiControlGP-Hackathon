## Features


OminiControl is a minimal yet powerful universal control framework for Diffusion Transformer models like [FLUX](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux).

* **Universal Control 🌐**:  A unified control framework that supports both subject-driven control and spatial control (such as edge-guided and in-painting generation).

* **Minimal Design 🚀**: Injects control signals while preserving original model structure. Only introduces 0.1% additional parameters to the base model.

## OminiControlGP (OminiControl for the GPU Poor) by DeepBeepMeep

With just one line adding the 'mmgp' module (https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/mmgp\), OminiControl can generate images from a derived Flux model in less than 6s with 16 GB of VRAM (profile 1), in 9s with 8 GB VRAM (profile 4) or in 16s with less than 6 GB of VRAM (profile 5) 

To run the Gradio app with a profile 3 (default profile, the fastest but requires the most VRAM):
```bash
python gradio_app --profile 3
```
To run the Gradio app with a profile 5 (a bit slower but requires only 6  GB of VRAM):
```bash
python gradio_app --profile 5
```

Additional useful flags:
```bash
python gradio_app --token YOUR_HF_TOKEN --server-name 0.0.0.0 --server-port 7860
```

You may check the mmgp git homepage if you want to design your own profiles (for instance to disable quantization).

If you enjoy this applcitation, you will certainly appreciate  these ones:\
- Hunyuan3D-2GP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Hunyuan3D-2GP\
A great image to 3D or text to 3D tool by the Tencent team. Thanks to mmgp it can run with less than 6 GB of VRAM

- HuanyuanVideoGP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/HunyuanVideoGP\
One of the best open source Text to Video generator

- FluxFillGP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/FluxFillGP\
One of the best inpainting / outpainting tools based on Flux that can run with less than 12 GB of VRAM.

- Cosmos1GP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Cosmos1GP\
This application include two models: a text to world generator and a image / video to world (probably the best open source image to video generator).

## News
- **2025-01-25**: ⭐️ DeepBeepMeep fork: added support for mmgp 
- **2024-12-26**: ⭐️ Training code are released. Now you can create your own OminiControl model by customizing any control tasks (3D, multi-view, pose-guided, try-on, etc.) with the FLUX model. Check the [training folder](./train) for more details.

## Quick Start
### Setup (Optional)
1. **Environment setup**
```bash
conda create -n omini python=3.10
conda activate omini
```
2. **Requirements installation**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage example
1. Subject-driven generation: `examples/subject.ipynb`
2. In-painting: `examples/inpainting.ipynb`
3. Canny edge to image, depth to image, colorization, deblurring: `examples/spatial.ipynb`



### Guidelines for subject-driven generation
1. Input images are automatically center-cropped and resized to 512x512 resolution.
2. When writing prompts, refer to the subject using phrases like `this item`, `the object`, or `it`. e.g.
   1. *A close up view of this item. It is placed on a wooden table.*
   2. *A young lady is wearing this shirt.*
3. The model primarily works with objects rather than human subjects currently, due to the absence of human data in training.

## Limitations
1. The model's subject-driven generation primarily works with objects rather than human subjects due to the absence of human data in training.
2. The subject-driven generation model may not work well with `FLUX.1-dev`.
3. The released model currently only supports the resolution of 512x512.

## Training
Training instructions can be found in this [folder](./train).


## To-do
- [x] Release the training code.
- [ ] Release the model for higher resolution (1024x1024).
